        <h4>Some information about my motivation, career and personal life</h4>
        <div class="hero-sign">
          <h3>Welcome!</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Armand Zorn. On 26 September 2021, I was elected to the German Parliament (Deutscher Bundestag – the constitutional and legislative body in Germany). I represent the electoral district Frankfurt am Main I.
            I am a “typical” citizen of Frankfurt. More than 50% Frankfurt’s citizens were not born in Frankfurt – and I am one of them. I was born in Cameroon and attended school in Yaoundé until the seventh grade. In 2000, I moved to Halle (Saale), Germany without the ability to speak German.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would love to hear from you and get your feedback, questions, or comments. To get in touch with me, please feel free to send me an email.
          </p>

          <p>All the best,</p>

    <!-- My Motivation -->

      <h2>My Motivation</h2>
      <h3>Fighting for a just and sustainable future</h3>
      <p>
        We are experiencing a structural change in the economy and society. Globalization, the climate crisis, digitalization and the Corona pandemic are creating a sense of insecurity and concern among many people. At the same time, it often seems as if politicians do not address many of the challenges faced by society in a decisive manner. Jointly with you, I am working to to end this gridlock. I am working towards political decisions that can secure a just and sustainable future.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am fighting for a society, in which all people have equal opportunities to participate in, and to develop and realize their goals and ambitions. We need policies and a political system giving people a sense of security and freedom, and confidence for the future. We need to understand change as an opportunity, for people, society and the natural environment. To achieve this, we need a strong and capable government.

      <h2>Background and Experience</h2>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Diligence and hard work</h3>
        <p>
          While I grew up in modest circumstances, I was always taught that with diligence and hard work, I can achieve my dreams. With the support of my parents and society, I have been able to develop and realize my potential.
          Without people who encouraged and inspired me, scholarships, and many part-time jobs, this would not have been possible. I was able to graduate high school and successfully study Political & Administrative Science, European Affairs, International Economics and Business Law in Halle (Saale), Paris, Chongqing (China), Konstanz and Bologna.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Working Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I gained professional experience at the Federal Ministry of Finance, the German Bundestag, the French National Assembly as well as at the Representation of the European Union in Hong Kong.
        </p>
        <p>
          During several years of working as a management consultant, I supported and advised companies on the digital transformation (and on dealing with associated risks and regulatory compliance).
          Before joining the German Bundestag, I worked as a project manager in international development cooperation and supported the development of a sustainable economy with the help of new technologies.

          <p>
            With the exception of budgetary policy, the Finance Committee’s remit is identical with that of the Federal Ministry of Finance. The role of the 45 members of the Finance Committee is to deliberate on the items referred to it by the plenary of the German Bundestag: in particular, draft bills introduced by the German Federal Government, the parliamentary groups and the Bundesrat, motions tabled by the parliamentary groups, reports submitted by the Federal Government and items from the European Union. The Finance Committee usually takes the lead role in any deliberations on financial market regulation (banks, securities trading and the insurance sector), the customs system and tax policy.

          <p>
            The Committee on Digital Affairs is dedicated to topical Internet policy issues, including the expansion of digital infrastructure. The 34 members aim to discuss the various aspects of digitalisation and connectivity using an interdisciplinary approach and take important decisions concerning the digital transformation. The Committee does not view Internet policy as a "niche topic". It views itself as a driving force for parliamentary work in this field.

          <p>
            The Committee on European Union Affairs is the central forum for the German Bundestag's participation in European matters. The committee’s existence is enshrined in the German constitution, the Basic Law. As a cross-sectoral yet specialised committee it deals amongst other things with all fundamental questions of European integration, institutional topics, strategy documents, the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework, and enlargement issues. It also has special powers and can, under certain circumstances, exercise the rights of the plenary. With 40 members and an equal number of substitutes, it is one of the Bundestag’s largest committees, and is chaired by Dr Anton Hofreiter (Alliance 90/The Greens). The Committee cultivates close ties to the European institutions and the European affairs committees of other national parliaments within the EU.
