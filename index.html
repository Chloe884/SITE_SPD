  <!-- About -->
  <section id="about" class="welcome">
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      On 26 September 2021, I was elected to the German Bundestag, representing the constituency of Frankfurt am Main I. 
      I was born in Yaoundé, Cameroon and lived there until the seventh grade. In 2000, I moved to Germany without speaking any German.

    <h2>My Motivation</h2>
    <h3>Fighting for a just and sustainable future</h3>
    <p>
      The world is changing: our society is undergoing profound structural changes. Globalisation, the climate crisis, 
      digitisation and the coronavirus pandemic are confronting us with major challenges. 
      To master these challenges, we need a capable state that acts decisively and seizes opportunities. 
      I want to play an active part in shaping this change.

  <!-- Background & Experience -->
  <section id="experience">
    <h2>Background and Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I grew up in modest circumstances, and education has always been the key to my opportunities. 
      I studied Politics and Public Administration, European Affairs, International Economics and Business Law 
      in Halle (Saale), Paris, Chongqing, Konstanz and Bologna.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Professionally, I have worked at the Federal Ministry of Finance, the German Bundestag, 
      the French National Assembly and the Representation of the European Union in Hong Kong. 
      Before being elected, I was a consultant on digital transformation, risk management and regulatory compliance.

          With the exception of budgetary policy, the Finance Committee’s remit is identical with that of the Federal Ministry of Finance. 
          It deliberates on draft bills, motions, reports and EU items. 
          It usually leads deliberations on financial market regulation, the customs system and tax policy.
