    <div class="container">
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>My name is Armand Zorn. On 26 September 2021, I was elected to the German Parliament (Deutscher Bundestag – the constitutional and legislative body in Germany). I represent the electoral district Frankfurt am Main I.</p>
      <p>I am a “typical” citizen of Frankfurt. More than 50% Frankfurt’s citizens were not born in Frankfurt – and I am one of them. I was born in Cameroon and attended school in Yaoundé until the seventh grade. In 2000, I moved to Halle (Saale), Germany without the ability to speak German.</p>
      <p>I would love to hear from you and get your feedback, questions, or comments. To get in touch with me, please feel free to send me an email.</p>
      <p>All the best,</p>

      <h2>My Motivation</h2>
      <p>We are experiencing a structural change in the economy and society. Globalization, the climate crisis, digitalization and the Corona pandemic are creating a sense of insecurity and concern among many people.</p>
      <p>I am fighting for a society in which all people have equal opportunities to participate, and to develop and realize their goals. We need policies and a political system giving people a sense of security and freedom.</p>
